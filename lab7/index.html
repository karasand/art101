		<hi>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</6>
			<p> I worked with Edith and Amelia on figuring out how objects and arrays work in Javascript.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> We all worked together to do Javascript on Chrome and then defining my variables. </p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Understanding how to make the arrays and objects actually work on Chrome was pretty difficult for me at first, but eventually with the help of my partners and the lecture slides I got it to work. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> It took quite a bit of messing around with the coding, but eventually I was able to get myTransport and myMainRide to work correctly. </p>
