		<hi>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> I worked with Edith and Amelia again to try to figure out how to make anon functions and callbacks work</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Trying to find my js function and trying to make it show up in my browser, but I just forgot to save! </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I was able to somewhat figure it out, but I'm still having some complications, and I'm still confused.   </p>
